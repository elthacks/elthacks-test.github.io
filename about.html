<p>Based in the UK, he's been teaching English as a foreign language since 2007 – working in Pamplona in Spain and south east London. Interested in making the most of minimal resources for teaching and basing lessons on the lives and language of the learners in the room, Mike is focused on his own development as an ELT professional – and on helping others to develop as well. Often speaking at conferences in the UK and Europe, Mike likes finding out about teaching in different places both in the UK and abroad – and connecting with teachers and other ELT professionals in these places.</p>
